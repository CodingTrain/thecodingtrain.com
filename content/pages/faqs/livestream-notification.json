  "question": "Where and when do you live stream? Can I get a notification?",
  "answer": {
    "text": "The best way to stay up to date on my schedule is to [join the Coding Train discord](/discord) and subscribe to the “notifications” role.\n Live streams occur on both [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codingtrainchoochoo) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/featured). Each platform has various options for receiving notifications. On YouTube, for example you can [subscribe to The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) and click the bell for all notifications. For streams scheduled in advance, they’ll be listed on the [homepage of this website](/)."
