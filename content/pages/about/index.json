  "title": "Hi! I’m Dan!",
  "description": "Thank you for visiting the Coding Train website! I love teaching and sharing code, and try my absolute best to do so in a fun and approachable way. I teach at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and serve on the Board of Directors of The Processing Foundation. I started making videos in 2012 and launched the Coding Train YouTube channel  in 2015.\n While I love to code it isn’t the only part of life and it doesn’t need to be for you either! I love to play music (which I do badly), solve rubik’s cubes (slowly), and go running with Gloria Pickle. ",
