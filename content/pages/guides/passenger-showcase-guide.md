Thank you for sharing your work in the Passenger Showcase! In the future, we hope to provide a form to make the submission process easier, but for now, please follow the instructions below to create a pull request for your project! If you have questions or need any help, come board the [Coding Train Discord](https://discord.gg/6DScedrtvH) or write to help@thecodingtrain.com.

This guide is in progress, and will be updated as the showcase submission process changes.

## Finding the Video

All submissions have to be associated with a specific video. Don't worry too much if you aren't sure, just pick wherever you think it fits best! If your work relates to multiple videos just pick one!

On the [GitHub repo homepage](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com), click the button in the upper left-hand corner where it says `main`. Type in the name of a branch (you can make this up!) and create the branch! In the example below I'm calling it `dan-showcase-submission`.

Navigate to the video folder. If the video is a coding challenge, then the video will be in `content/videos/challenges/number-challenge-name`.

If the video is a part of a series, chances are it is either in a main or side track on the site, both of which are found in `content/videos/`. If you can't find it, [file an issue to ask](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/issues)!

## Creating the Showcase JSON File

If the video already has showcase projects. you will see a `showcase` folder. Click "Add file" in the upper right-hand corner and click "Create new file" (or "Upload files'', if you prefer to create the file on your local machine). Name the file `contribution2.json`, if that exists `contribution3.json`, etc). If you are the first one, name the file `showcase/contribution1.json` (this will create the folder too!)

![Creating a new file in the showcases folder](./passenger-showcase/showcasefolder.png)

Copy the template into the new file:

```js
{
  "title": "Project Title",
  "url": "Link to your project",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name (or nickname!)",
    "url": "Link to more about you! (your personal site, GitHub, social media, etc.)"
  },
}
```

![Editing the contribution](./passenger-showcase/editor.png)

Fill out the title, name, url, etc. Your URL can be anything, a p5 sketch, a blog post, GitHub repo, YouTube video, etc. After you've completed the data, click the green button below the editor that says "Commit new file".

## Adding a Preview Image

All showcase projects should include a thumbnai preview image! It can be just about any resolution or aspect ratio (the site will resize and crop as necessary). The format should be `JPG` or `PNG`. Name your thumbnail image with the same filename as your showcase submission (`contribution1.png`, `contribution2.jpg`, etc.). You can drag and drop the image file into the same directory to add it to the pull request!

## Submitting a Pull Request

[Return to the main branch](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/tree/main), and select "Compare & pull request" (or go to the “Pull requests” tab and create a pull request by selecting "New pull request", then "compare: main" and choosing `your-branch-name` from the dropdown)

A member of the Coding Train team will review your pull request and merge it into the site!
