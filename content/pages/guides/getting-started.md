## Welcome!

If you‚Äôre new to coding, getting started can feel overwhelming, hopefully this passenger guide will help you with everything you need to begin! üíñ

## Start Learning and Coding!

There are two main tracks you can follow for total and complete beginners.

### Creative Coding for Beginners - Full Course!

<Video videoId="4JzDttgdILQ" />

The [Learning Processing Track](/tracks/learning-processing) is the newest beginner series on the Coding Train! It covers all of the fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, loops, functions, objects, arrays) in Java with Processing.

### Code! Programming with p5.js

The [Code! Programming with p5.js Track](/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js) focuses on the fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions & objects) with JavaScript.

## Languages

<Video videoId="AmlAiKsiy0o" listId="PLRqwX-V7Uu6Z1JcqC1iG1oEsJrLX1IK5L" />

In almost all of the videos, you‚Äôll find me using [Processing](https://processing.org/) or [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). Processing is a software sketchbook and language (built on top of Java) for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. p5.js is a JavaScript library that comes with a friendly online web editor for creative coding. Both projects are maintained by [The Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/).

If you are interested in learning web development, p5.js is a way to get started with the very basics of JavaScript which will lead you into doing more with HTML (the markup language that defines the structure of a web page) and CSS (a language that defines the style and look of a web page).

## Tools

For a beginner, I recommend the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), it‚Äôs probably the most used coding environment! If you are using Processing, it comes [with its own development environment](https://processing.org/download)! You can also explore a downloadable text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for either! I cover tools beyond p5.js and Processing in [my 2023 workflow video](/tracks/2018-workflow/discord/2023-workflow). There are many text editors out there ‚Äì feel free to use whichever makes your coding experience comfortable!

## Version Control

Working with ‚Äúversion control‚Äù software (like [git](https://git-scm.com/)) and collaborating on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be a confusing and intimidating experience when you are first beginning! It‚Äôs not something you need to learn immediately, you can stick with p5.js and the basics of coding for quite some time first!

When you have some code you want to share or publish online outside of the web editor, you‚Äôll want to consider signing up for a GitHub account and learning the basics of version control. You can use this website ([all of the source code and content is on GitHub](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com)) as a place for you to learn!

To learn more, take a ride on the [‚ÄúGit and GitHub for Poets‚Äù track](/tracks/git-and-github-for-poets). This series is a primer on version control and the difference between git software and the GitHub website.

The videos in cover terminology like branch, fork, merge, pull, push, and remote. There‚Äôs even [a friendly ‚Äúplayground repository‚Äù](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Poem) for you to make your first pull request!

You can also learn more about how I integrate git into my workflow in [my 2018 workflow series](/tracks/2018-workflow).
