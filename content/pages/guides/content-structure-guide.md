# Content structure guide for The Coding Train team

_Last update: February 17th 2022_

On december 3rd 2021, we decided to start adding real content to this project. This guide serves as a way to understand how the workflow feels and if the content structure may need to be changed.

With that in mind, the purpose of this guide is to explain the structure of content that feeds the new Coding Train website that is being developed. As we learn about how the setup feels and works,
this guide will be updated accordingly.

## Content folder structure

For now, we'll be just considering content concerning videos and tracks.
They are all kept in the `content/` folder, inside the `videos/` and `tracks/` directories respectively.

The `guides/` folder currently has the website user guides that are in the existing Coding Train website, and are just placeholders for now that would need updating once we settle on the content folder setup.

Similarly, the `talks/` folder contains talk information for the about page, and `collaborators.json` contains information on the sites collaborators. All these can be ignored for now, but feel free to point out aspects that may need tweaks or add real data there too.

The rationale behind the current structure is that videos are the building blocks of content from which tracks are composes from.

```
content
├─ videos
│  ├─ video-folder-1
│  ├─ video-folder-2
│  ├─ ...
│  └─ challenges
└─ tracks
   ├─ main-tracks
   └─ side-tracks
```

## Videos

Videos tackle specific themes and are part of a sequence of videos. Each video should have their own folder inside of `content/videos/`.

**Challenges** are a special kind of video, that can be part of tracks but also exists as one-off videos with the intention of inviting viewers to their contributions based on the challenge or coding experiment.
This are contained **specifically** inside of `content/videos/challenges`.

<!-- - **Guest tutorials** are one-off lessons on different subjects given by guests lecturers -->

Each video, whatever flavor of video they are, follow a similar folder structure:

```
[videos|challenges]
└─ video-slug
   ├─ index.json
   ├─ images
   │  ├─ image1.png
   │  ├─ image2.jpg
   │  └─ ...
   └─ showcase
      ├─ contribution-slug-1.json
      ├─ contribution-slug-2.json
      └─ ...

```

- `video-slug/` contains all data related to a specific video. The slug is used to identify the video and reference it on track definitions, and they also become part of the path to their video player pages.
- `video-slug/index.json` contains the main metadata for the video: title, description, YouTube video ID, etc...
- `video-slug/images/` contains images specific to the video and can be referenced in `video-slug/index.json` as code example thumbnails.
- `video-slug/showcase/` contains all metadata for contributions that viewers send and are accepted into the site to be part of the Passenger Showcase of the video.
- `video-slug/showcase/contribution-slug.json` contains the metadata for the contribution to be showcased: title, author information, links to code or live versions, etc...

### Metadata

Each video's metadata file (`video-slug/index.json`) is a JSON file. Each file has the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Video title",
  "description": "Video description",
  "videoNumber": "Video number",
  "videoId": "YouTube video ID",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "languages": ["language1", "language2"],
  "topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
  "canContribute": true,
  "relatedChallenges": ["challenge-1-slug", "challenge-2-slug"],
  "timestamps": [
    { "time": "0:00", "title": "Title 1" },
    { "time": "1:26", "title": "Title 2" },
    { "time": "1:26", "title": "Title 3" }
  ],
  "codeExamples": [
    {
      "title": "Code example 1 title",
      "description": "Code example 1 description",
      "image": "image1.png",
      "urls": {
        "p5": "url to p5 editor or code",
        "processing": "url to processing sketch",
        "other": "url to other source, like GitHub"
      }
    },
    {
      "title": "Code example 2 title",
      "description": "Code example 2 description",
      "image": "image2.png",
      "urls": {
        "other": "url to other source, like GitHub"
      }
    }
  ],
  "groupLinks": [
    {
      "title": "Group of links title",
      "links": [
        {
          "title": "Link 1 title",
          "url": "link 1 url",
          "description": "description of content linked"
        },
        {
          "title": "Link 2 title",
          "url": "link 2 url",
          "description": "description of content linked"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Most of the properties should translate directly from the current setup. `"title"`, `"description"`, and `"videoId"`, are the only required properties. The rest have a fallback value if not set.

#### Video numbers

We are currently undecided on whether videos should be numbered or not. Currently, videos have numbers in their titles on YouTube and the current website, but the new website might not need them.

We currently have a `"videoNumber"` property in the video JSON that can be set to whatever you want, and it's currently not used in the website.

> **NOTE**: This is an open question to The Coding Train team. If you could give us insight to whether this video number is needed in general or just for some cases, that would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to propose how video numbers should or should not be used.

#### Video IDs

Similar to the current site setup, this property makes reference to video ID found at the end of a YouTube video link. Only the ID is the value expected here, not the whole URL.

#### Languages and topics

The actual values for these haven't been decided, so we are open for you to suggest the set of possible values to have as options. There's no limit on how many languages and topics can be specified on each video, but often one or two should be appropriate.

If `"languages"` or `"topics"` aren't set, they will default to an empty array.

#### Passenger Showcase contribution enabling

This property let's us disable the intention for users to send contributions for that specific videos. This property would show or hide the contributions panel and button in a specific video by setting `"canContribute"` to `true` or `false` respectively. If `"canContribute"` is not set, lessons and guest tutorials default to `false` and challenges to `true`.

#### Related challenges

This property let's us link challenges to a specific video in any way see fit. It's an array of slugs, which should match the path slug of a challenge to correctly reference it. If it's not defined or is left empty, then no challenge panel is shown in the corresponding video page. Multiple slugs can be added, but only the first two will be shown in the page currently.

#### Code examples

`"codeExamples"` are thought to contain objects that reference the main code shown in the video. Referenced images can be contained in the corresponding `images/` folder in the video's directory.

- `"image"` should directly reference a subfolder inside of `images/`.
- `"urls"` contain all code sources specific to that code example `"p5"`, `"processing"` or `"node"` are possible languages we support, and `"other"` is a fallback option.

If `"codeExamples"` isn't set, it will default to an empty array.

#### Group Links

Group links are a more general abstraction for specifying related groups of links that can be used to specify the "Links discussed" section of videos, "Guest contact information" for guest tutorials,
"Videos discussed", or whatever new section is needed for each video.

In the case of "Videos discussed" or whatever content that lives in the Coding Train site,
instead of specifying the whole url to the resource, the URL can contain the sub-path in the site for that resource that starts with `/`.

The `"description"` and `"icon"` properties are optional, but `"title"` and `"url"` are required.

For now, `"icon"` expects a short emoji string that relates to the link. In the future this may also support adding coding train characters.

`"description"` on the other hand can be a longish string that describes the link or something about it. It may also contain MD style urls that will be parsed, so it may also contain anchor links related to the link. For example: `"By [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) and [DSI](https://designsystems.international/)!"`.

If `"groupLinks"` isn't set, it will default to an empty array.

#### Passenger Showcase

All Passenger Showcase Contributions' should have metadata files (`video-slug/showcase/contribution-slug.json`) that are also JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Contribution title",
  "author": {
    "name": "Author name",
    "url": "Author url to own website or GitHub"
  },
  "url": "URL to live code of contribution",
  "videoId": "YouTube video ID to video of contribution",
  "source": "URL to source code of contribution"
}
```

Similar to the current one,
`"title"`, `"author: {"name"}"` are required, and either `"url"`, `"videoId"` or `"source"` is expected.

#### Images

We also currently support the addition of images related to videos and their showcase to use in the website.

```
[videos|challenges]
├─ placeholder.[png|jpg]
└─ video-slug
   ├─ index.json
   ├─ index.[png|jpg]
   └─ showcase
      ├─ contribution-slug-1.json
      ├─ contribution-slug-1.[png|jpg]
      ├─ contribution-slug-2.json
      └─ ...

```

- `video-slug/showcase/contribution-slug.[png|jpg]` is an optional image (either PNG or JPG) to add at the showcase folder of a video.
  It would be used to visually preview the contribution made by a viewer.
  It should share the file name with their corresponding contribution.
- `video-slug/index.[png|jpg]` is an optional image (either PNG or JPG) to add at the root of a video directory.
  It will be used as visual representation of the video when listed in different pages,
  and also as a placeholder for contributions that also don't include their own `showcase/contribution-slug.[png|jpg]` image.
- `placeholder.[png|jpg]` is a **required** image (either PNG or JPG) to be used as a placeholder for whether a specific video doesn't include their corresponding image at `video-slug/index.[png|jpg]`.
  This image also may be used as a placeholder for contributions that also don't include their own `showcase/contribution-slug.[png|jpg]` image and don't have a video image to fallback on.

Feel free to also update the current placeholder images!

### Tracks

On the other hand, tracks come in two types: main and side tracks.

**Main tracks** are the core and principal courses available in the coding train, which seek to teach a big theme of multiple videos. Main tracks also are composed of a sequence of chapters,
where each one is further composed of a sequence of videos.

**Side tracks** are curated collection of videos from potentially different contexts that relate on a connecting theme. Side tracks are a simple sequence of videos.

The current setup separates folders for main and side tracks, and inside those individual folders per track.

```
tracks
├─ main-tracks
│  ├─ track-slug-1
│  │  └─ index.json
│  └─ track-slug-2
│     └─ index.json
└─ side-tracks
   ├─ track-slug-3
   │  └─ index.json
   ├─ track-slug-4
   │  └─ index.json
   └─ ...
```

Each `track-slug/` folder defines a new track and contains the track metadata in `index.json`.

#### Metadata

Metadata for main and side tracks are very similar,
they just differ in a property to define the video collection it includes. The properties `"title"` and `"description"` are all common and required to be set.

For main tracks, the required property to define the collection is `"chapters"`. This defines an ordered sequence of chapters, where each is an ordered collection of videos. Each chapter should also have a `"title"` defined. To reference specific video, the same slug names used for subfolders in the `videos/` folder should be used.

```json
{
  "title": "Main track title",
  "description": "Main track description",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "title": "First chapter title",
      "videos": ["video-1-slug", "video-2-slug"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Second chapter title",
      "videos": ["video-3-slug", "video-4-slug"]
    }
  ]
}
```

For side tracks, the required property is `"videos"`, which is a plain video sequence array.

```json
{
  "title": "Side track title",
  "description": "Side track description",
  "videos": ["video-1-slug", "challenges/video-2-slug", "video-3-slug"]
}
```

#### Images

Similar to videos, we currently support the addition of an image for each track to use as a cover in different pages.

The `tracks/[main|side]-tracks/track-slug/index.[png|jpg]` images are each track individual cover images and their presence is optional.

```
tracks
├─ main-tracks
│  ├─ placeholder.[png|jpg]
│  ├─ track-slug-1
│  │  ├─ index.[png|jpg]
│  │  └─ index.json
│  └─ track-slug-2
│     ├─ index.[png|jpg]
│     └─ index.json
└─ side-tracks
   ├─ placeholder.[png|jpg]
   ├─ track-slug-3
   |  ├─ index.[png|jpg]
   │  └─ index.json
   ├─ track-slug-4
   |  ├─ index.[png|jpg]
   │  └─ index.json
   └─ ...
```

On the other hand, the `tracks/[main|side]-tracks/placeholder.[png|jpg]` images are required and will be used as fallback for each side of tracks that don't have a cover image.

### Nested folders in video folders

Because of the amount of videos, the `videos`, and `videos/challenges` folders may get very populated very quickly which can make file organization hard to query and maintain.

To help against that, video folder definitions can be further organized in arbitrary nested folders in any fashion that make sense to the content maintainers.
When doing this, tracks and videos that reference videos in nested folders must use the whole relative path to specifically reference the video instead of just using the folder slug.

For instance, videos may be organized based on the tracks and chapters that define them:

```
videos
├─ placeholder.[png|jpg]
├─ challenges/
└─ track-name
   ├─ chapter-1
   │  ├─ video-1-slug
   │  │  ├─ index.json
   │  │  ├─ index.[png|jpg]
   │  │  └─ showcase
   │  │     └─ ...
   │  └─ video-2-slug
   │     ├─ index.json
   │     ├─ index.[png|jpg]
   │     └─ showcase
   │        └─ ...
   └─ chapter-2
      ├─ video-3-slug
      │  ├─ index.json
      │  ├─ index.[png|jpg]
      │  └─ showcase
      │     └─ ...
      └─ video-4-slug
         └─ ...
```

This would result in less folders directly inside of `videos`.

To reference it in a track, the relative paths from `videos` should be used.

```json
{
  "title": "Main track title",
  "description": "Main track description",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "title": "First chapter title",
      "videos": [
        "track-name/chapter-1/video-1-slug",
        "track-name/chapter-1/video-2-slug"
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Second chapter title",
      "videos": [
        "track-name/chapter-2/video-3-slug",
        "track-name/chapter-2/video-4-slug"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "title": "Side track title",
  "description": "Side track description",
  "videos": [
    "track-name/chapter-1/lesson-1-slug",
    "challenges/video-2-slug",
    "video-3-slug"
  ]
}
```

### Testing folder structure

Test scripts are added to the site that checks if all going on inside of `content/` is as expected.

Both commands `npm run test` and `npm run testv` run all available tests through the directory tree. The first one will only show a summary of the testing results and all failed tests, while `testv` would also do this but also log all the individual tests done (v for verbose).

Four types of tests are currently included:

- Testing the folder structure inside `content/`: checks that expected folders are present and that folder's that aren't expected aren't there. This also takes into account multi-level folders for certain specific cases, like content/videos.
- Testing file presence in each folder inside `content/`: similarly as with folders, required files are also checked to be present, and checks there aren't other not expected files.
- Testing that all present JSON files follow expected structure for their type. Track JSON files should have certain properties, while video JSON files should have another set of properties defined.
- Testing that all mentioned slug strings in JSON files correctly reference other existing files/folders. Hopefully this makes notice of spelling errors when referencing videos.
