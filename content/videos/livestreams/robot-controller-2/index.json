  "description": "In this livestream, I'm rejoined by Dr. Christian Hubicki to continue our series on robot controllers. Dr. Hubicki gives a presentation on the history of legged robots (like ASIMO and Boston Dynamics) and the principles behind the Raibert Hopper. Then, we attempt to implement a 1D hopping robot simulation in p5.js using a PID controller.",
