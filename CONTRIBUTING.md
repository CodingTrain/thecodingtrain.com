### Getting Started

Here is a guide to the content structure of the website to help you through the process of contributing.

- [Content Structure Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/blob/main/content/pages/guides/content-structure-guide.md)

## Contributing to Coding Train

Here are the types of contributions we are looking for:

1. Share your creative work inspired by a coding challenge or tutorial in the showcase!

   - You can submit your showcase with the [Passenger Showcase Form](https://thecodingtrain.com/submit)

2. Add a new track to the site! (https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/issues/279)

   - “Main Tracks” are sequenced video tutorials that you can follow like a course syllabus. Most of the main tracks are already ported on the site.
   - “Side Tracks” are collections of related videos but don’t necessarily need to be watched in order. Is there a collection of videos that go together well that you'd want to be able to share via a single URL? You are welcome to propose and curate side tracks for the website!
   - Check out the [Content Structure Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/blob/main/content/pages/guides/content-structure-guide.md) for more information on the content structure for tracks.

3. More!
   - You can find more things to [work on listed in issues](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/issues).

### Issues

If you are about to create a new issue, search if an issue already exists regarding the same problem. If a related issue doesn't exist, go ahead and open an issue describing the problem. An issue could be about a bug that you discovered, a suggested change or even a discussion.

To find an issue that you want to fix, scan through the list. You may find that the `labels` are helpful in this situation. You can use them as a filter as well while searching.

### Making Changes

- To make changes to this repository, make sure to fork it and make changes to your fork locally, without harming the original project.
- It is good practice to create a different branch for different changes.
- Commit the changes you are making at every step, and make sure to add good commit messages describing the part you added/changed with that specific commit.
- When you are happy with your changes and are ready to publish them, make a pull request. We will review your suggested changes and hopefully merge them!

### Development Environment

Make sure you have Node.js version `20.x` as well as npm installed. You can find how to test your changes locally [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com#development-info).
