# Contributing to The Coding Train with Hacktoberfest

This Hacktoberfest, here are the ways you can contribute to The Coding Train:

1. **Share your creative work on the Passenger Showcase!**

   - For your submission to count towards Hacktoberfest, you must manually create a Pull Request to the website repository. You can follow along with the [Passenger Showcase Guide](https://thecodingtrain.com/guides/passenger-showcase-guide) (scroll down below the form) to create your Pull Request.

2. **Curate content for the website**

   - Add a new side track to the site! Side Tracks are collections of related videos but donâ€™t necessarily need to be watched in order. Is there a collection of videos that go together? You are welcome to propose and curate tracks for the website!
