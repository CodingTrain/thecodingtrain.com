# Contributing to The Coding Train with Hacktoberfest

This Hacktoberfest, here are the ways you can contribute to The Coding Train:

1. **Share your creative work on the Passenger Showcase!**

   - For your submission to count towards Hacktoberfest, you must manually create a Pull Request to the website repository. You can follow along with the [Passenger Showcase Guide](http://thecodingtrain.com/passenger-showcase-guide) (scroll down below the form) to create your Pull Request.

2. **Curate content for the website**

   - Add a new side track to the site! Side Tracks are collections of related videos but don’t necessarily need to be watched in order. Is there a collection of videos that go together? You are welcome to propose and curate tracks for the website!
   - Fix typos and errors in existing metadata. (`topics`, `languages`, `timestamps`)
   - For more information on the content structure for tracks and videos, check out the [Content Structure Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

3. Remix the Coding Train Logo!

   - Check out https://github.com/CodingTrain/Coding-Train-Logo.

4. More!

   - You can contribute to other [Coding Train repositories](https://github.com/CodingTrain/) as well. You will need to ask for the Pull Request to be accepted for Hacktoberfest to count it towards your progress.
