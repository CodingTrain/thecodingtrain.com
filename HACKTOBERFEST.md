# Contributing to The Coding Train with Hacktoberfest

This Hacktoberfest, here are the ways you can contribute to The Coding Train:

## Share your creative work on the Passenger Showcase

This is a great option if you are new to open source contributions. For your submission to count towards Hacktoberfest, you must manually create a Pull Request to the website repository. You can follow along with the [Passenger Showcase Guide](https://thecodingtrain.com/guides/passenger-showcase-guide) (scroll down below the form to "Finding the Video on Github") to create your Pull Request. Here are some additional resources that can help you get started:

- [Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV): A Coding Train video series for Git and GitHub beginners.
- [Collaborating With Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests): A GitHub guide on pull requests.

## Experienced Contributors - Curate content for the website

If you are an experienced contributor, consider adding a new side track to the site! Side Tracks are collections of related videos but donâ€™t necessarily need to be watched in order. Please read through the existing issues to see which tracks have been requested. If you are interested in adding a track, please leave a comment in the issue before you start.

 For more information on the content structure for tracks and videos, check out the [Content Structure Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/thecodingtrain.com/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
